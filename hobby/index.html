							<p>
								Hello! My name is Jaden Peterson; I'm a junior computer science
								student at the University of North Carolina and a part-time
								software engineer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Although the bulk of my time is spent on schoolwork, work,
								recreational programming, and miscellaneous school obligations,
								I highly enjoy rollerskating, specifically inline skating.
							</p>

							<p>
								I began skating in about 2012 at the age of 9. Then, my parents
								bought me my first pair of inline skates as a Christmas present,
								which incited my love for the activity.

					<p>
						Rollerskating is a family of versatile leg-oriented activities centered
						around the rollerskate, a wearable shoe with typically three or four wheels.
						Unlike ice skating, which is confined to the frozen lake or ice rink,
						rollerskating can be performed on any flat surface, irrespective of
						conditions.
					</p>

					<p>
						Rollerskates can be divided into two types: ordinary "quads" whose wheels
						are fixed in a two-by-two matrix, and inline skates, whose wheels
						lie in a line (hence the name). The former are easier to learn;
						the latter are primarily optimized for speed and rigor.

							<h2 class="tab-content-title">Where I've Skated</h2>
							<p>
								Generally, I prefer skating in either traditional indoor
								roller rinks or outdoor roads either of concrete or asphault.
								Typically, I reserve the former for social events in which I'm
								skating with others and the latter for more solo and impromptu
								skating.
							</p>

							<h3>Indoor Skating</h3>
							<p>
								I prefer roller rinks because their surfaces are optimized for
								skating (they're smooth, yet high-friction) and their music and
								social ammenities enrich the experience. When in California,
								Skatetown in Roseville was my favorite rink to frequent.
							</p>

							<h3>Outdoor Skating</h3>
							<p>
								Ourdoor skating environments vary more; although they're usually
								more dangerous (due to rough terrain, the presence of vehicles, and
								steep slopes), they can be incredibly fun and are an excellent
								opportunity to train without having to worry about clumsy children
								on a public rink.

					<h2 class="tab-content-title">How I Skate</h2>
					<p>
						As my passion for inline skating has been nurtured, the purpose of my
						skating has shifted from one of recreation to improving my form and
						exercising. To enforce appropriate form, I most often skate with my hands
						behind my back (because one should never rely on one's arms for balance).
					</p>

					<p>
						Occasionally, though, I find an excitingly steep slope and can't resist
						skating down:

							<h2 class="tab-content-title">Why I Enjoy It</h2>

							<p>
								Ultimately, I can't precisely explain why I enjoy inline skating and
								instead can only enumerate aspects of the experience that make it
								preferrable to others. A few are:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Its versatility and performability in many environments</li>
								<li>Its cost-effectiveness</li>
								<li>Its speed and thrill</li>
								<li>Its intersection with dance and music</li>
