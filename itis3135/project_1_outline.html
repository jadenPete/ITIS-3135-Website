				<h2>Project 1 Outline</h2>
			

			
	<h3>Singatopore</h3>

	<p class="project-paragraph">
		Singatopore is a nonprofit organization whose purpose is to provide food, shelter,
		and nurturement for the stray cats of Singapore, specifically those roaming around
		the National University of Singapore (NUS) area.
	</p>

	<p class="project-paragraph">
		The collective is led by cat advocate and well-regarded commutity volunteer
		Amanda Lim. Amanda is a senior business analytics student at NUS and aspiring
		software engineer who's mission is to improve the quality of life of the city's
		stray pets via a community-oriented approach.
	</p>

	<h4>Website Users</h4>

	<p class="project-paragraph">
		Singatopore's website would be targeted towards prospective members of the
		organization. Additionally, if the organization wished to direct any adoption
		or crowdsourcing efforts, the website would serve outside contributors.
	</p>


	<h4>Website Content</h4>

	<p class="project-paragraph">
		Perhaps the website's most useful function will be to catalog the community's
		documented stray catsâ€”their names, pictures, physical measurements, attributes, and
		preferences. Through this information, the organization can inform proximate locals
		of the cats and empower them to develop closer relationships with the cats.
	</p>

	<h4>Client Information</h4>

	<p class="project-paragraph">
		As mentioned, Amanda Lim, the president of Singatopore, is leading the initiative to
		create Singatopore's website. Being in her final year of university and having to
		tend to her other presidential duties, Amanda has contacted me to develop the site.
	</p>

			non-natives attempting to visit the cats

		<li>
			<b>Data collection:</b> N/A
		</li>
